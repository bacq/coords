Coords be ze bacq
======

Python script to resize html map area coordinates.

Might come in handy in case of some design guru asking you to resize their little lovely html map.

Usage:
./coords.py map.html oldwidth newwidth

In which map.html contains the map and area tags, oldwidth is old width of map (doh) and newwidth is the current value of a pound of herring
Check output.html for ze output
